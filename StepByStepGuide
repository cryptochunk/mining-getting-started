Get a 120GB cheap SSD = 1,500
640W Power Supply = 3,800
Monitor = 5,000
Keyboard and Mouse = 1,000
Graphics Card (This is the most important) 4x2060 for 50k = 2,00,000
GPU Risers - 800x4 = 3,200
Riser Power Cable = 1,200
Wooden Rig = 250
Motherboard power switch = 40
USB Pendrive = 300
Total = 35,290 + 2,00,000 = 2,35,290.00

To create an Ethereum wallet address.
Create an account in Kucoin or Binance.
Or use a wallet app like - Exodus or Metamask.
Get the ETH address.
Goto the mining folder in your desktop, goto NBMiner folder.
Right click on the start_eth.bat and click edit.
Delete the long hexadecimal value after -u and paste your ETH address.
Change from the default pool by removing the value after -o and before -u and replace it with - asia-eth.2miners.com:2020
Double click start_eth.bat this should start mining ethereum now.
Disable the login screen -  Google “Disable login screen windows 10” and follow the steps.
