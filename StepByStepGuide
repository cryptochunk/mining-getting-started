Get a 120GB cheap SSD = 1,500
640W Power Supply = 3,800
Monitor = 5,000
Keyboard and Mouse = 1,000
Graphics Card (This is the most important) 4x2060 for 50k = 2,00,000
GPU Risers - 800x4 = 3,200
Riser Power Cable = 1,200
Wooden Rig = 250
Motherboard power switch = 40
USB Pendrive = 300
Total = 35,290 + 2,00,000 = 2,35,290.00

The USB cable is connected firmly in the PCIe1x card and in the riser.
To create an Ethereum wallet address.
Create an account in Kucoin or Binance.
Or use a wallet app like - Exodus or Metamask.
Get the ETH address.
Goto the mining folder in your desktop, goto NBMiner folder.
Right click on the start_eth.bat and click edit.
Delete the long hexadecimal value after -u and paste your ETH address.
Change from the default pool by removing the value after -o and before -u and replace it with - asia-eth.2miners.com:2020
Double click start_eth.bat this should start mining ethereum now.
Disable the login screen -  Google “Disable login screen windows 10” and follow the steps.
To make sure mining starts after booting automatically
Click Start, type run, open the run window and paste this, make sure to replace <user> with what you see in C:\Users.
