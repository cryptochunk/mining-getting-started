To start with make sure you have gathered all the required hardware listed [here](https://github.com/cryptochunk/mining-getting-started/blob/main/hardware-requirements.md) to build the mining rig.

Now, follow the steps in sequence mentioned in this [link](https://github.com/cryptochunk/mining-getting-started/blob/main/steps-to-build-the-rig.md) to assemble the mining rig.

Bonus!! Access this [link](https://github.com/cryptochunk/mining-getting-started/blob/main/list-of-crypto-currencies-and-algorithm.md) to get a list of some Cryptocurrencies along with their algorithms that can be mined using the newly built rig.
